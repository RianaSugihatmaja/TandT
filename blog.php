    <h2> How Writing Journal Helps My Mental Health </h2>
        <p class="article">Journaling has been a part of my life since I was a little girl, not only that it helps me mentally, but it also helps me to stay creative and productive. I cannot stress it enough how writing down thoughts, emotions, ideas or even doodle on papers can help us to be on top of things.
        <br>As human we have limited ability to process and save information including but not limited to work, social or personal information. Internet and social media also play a big part in using up the space in our head. Overflowing information that we take in consciously or unconsciously can exhaust our mind and lead to several mental issues like anxiety, insecurity, panic attack, depression and more if it is not managed properly. 
        <br>The awareness of mental health has significantly increased in the recent years especially in developed countries. 
        <br>It is a big improvement that people have earned to be able to talk about their mental health more freely, since for the longest time talking about it is considered taboo and weak. 
        <br>Nowadays, there are many non-profit, private and governmental organizations providing therapy for people who need mental treatment. 
        <br>In addition to all those services, I believe that all of us need to learn and practice to protect and treat ourselves from within. And one of the easiest, most accessible way is to journal. By writing down all the emotions that we are feeling, we can try to figure out a pattern of thoughts and behaviors that lead to stress. From there we can try to make a game plan to caught ourselves and cut its chain. On top of that, James Pennebaker, PhD and Joshua Smyth, PhD from University of Texas at Austin and Syracuse University suggest that writing down feelings and emotions can improve immune functioning when it’s done properly. They believe that journaling should be done to learn from the emotions and then evaluate them, otherwise the benefit of it cannot be used effectively.
        <br>As someone who has practiced journaling for a while, I have several techniques that have helped me to write and understand and myself better.
        <br><h3>Acknowledge and Explain</h3> 
        The first technique that I use very often is to dedicate one blank page as an acknowledgment page where I will write down all the emotions I’m feeling without filters or organization. By doing this I am labeling and acknowledging my emotions, and it helps to release a bit of weight off my chest and mind. Sometimes even just by doing this I would feel more relaxed already.
        <br>The next page is an explanation page for tracking down the reason I’m feeling those emotions. Having an order to the writing is not the priority in this stage, I would just try to be as honest and non-judgmental as possible. After I feel like I have sorted out all my emotions, then I would try to draw conclusion at the end of the page. From doing this I can put some order in my previously chaotic mind and give me a perspective of what my problem actually is and find solutions to it.
        <br><h3>Story Telling</h3>
        Another way of journaling that I like to do is telling the story that makes me sad. I will describe the situation and rant on what makes me angry even if it is unreasonable. It helps express my feelings and thoughts on the situation without possibly hurting anyone or putting myself in a more difficult situation. This generally helps me calm down so that I can revisit the problem later in a better judgement. The point of doing this is to be aware of what our immediate response, behavior, and feelings to upsetting events and then learn to manage them if similar situation presented itself in the future. Practicing this can save us from many unnecessary problems and stress.
